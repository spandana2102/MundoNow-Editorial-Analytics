---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Merge and clean multi-month editorial datasets
- Match editorial content with GA4 metrics
- Build dashboards in **Looker Studio** and **Power BI**
- Identify high-performing categories and audience behavior
- Provide editorial strategy recommendations

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation (Python)
- Combined four monthly datasets into one dataset (181 articles)
- Cleaned category inconsistencies and formatting issues
- Resolved GA export encoding issues (UTF-8 / UTF-16 / Latin1)
- Normalized headlines to match editorial tracker with GA data

---

## 📊 Looker Studio Dashboard
Key KPIs:
- Total Views  
- Key Events  
- Event Count  
- Average Engagement Time  

Findings:
- **Politics & International** lead views and engagement  
- **Economy & Crime** show smaller but loyal audiences  
- **Lifestyle & Entertainment** generate visits but low retention  
- Audience behavior shows **quick readers vs deep readers**

## 🖥 Power BI Dashboard
This repo also includes a Power BI version of the dashboard for interactive BI exploration.

## 🧠 Recommendations
1. Focus content resources on high-engagement categories (Politics, International)
2. Improve scroll-depth tracking in GA4 for better retention metrics
3. Add richer visuals (video/infographics) for medium-engagement categories
4. Standardize editorial tagging to reduce future data cleaning complexity
